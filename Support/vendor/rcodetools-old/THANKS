Some names forgotten, tell me if you care :) -- mfp

rubikitch
* expanded xmp3.rb (a previous version of xmpfilter.rb) to support RSpec expectations
* wrote the elisp magic to use xmpfilter.rb with emacs
* made the 100% accurate, editor-independent completion system
[rubikitch took xmpfilter and turned it into the much more powerful
rcodetools, so there are way too many things to list them here :)]

Adagios
* found & fixed problem with rcodetools.vim plugin on win32
