method_analyzer.rb can be used to gather precise information about the exact
methods called in your code, allowing you to explore it better with rct-doc
(see README.emacs and README.vim for more information). This requires high
code coverage, since it can only record such data when the code is executed.

rct-meth-args can be used to generate fairly complete TAGS files. It operates
by loading the specified files and tracking method definitions; therefore, it
is meta-programming aware, unlike other implementations.

You can use them conveniently by adding the code shown in
Rakefile.method_analysis to your Rakefile.
